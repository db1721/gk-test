                <h2>Bio - Michael Karpstein</h2>
                <p>I grew up in the Seattle, WA area and have always had a love for my country and the freedoms it offers. After graduating High School, I spent 2 years serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Upon returning I married my wife and high school sweetheart Nicole. I grew up in a military family where my grandpa, Dad and brother served, after being married for a couple of years I decided it was time for me to join the armed forces as well. I have served in Afghanistan where I conducted Personnel Recovery missions as a BlackHawk Crewchief. My family has been continuing to grow and we are now living in Japan while I am on assignment. I have always enjoyed tinkering and building things, I have many hobbies that encourage this, one of which is building firearms.</p>
